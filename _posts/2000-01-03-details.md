                <ul>
                  <li>Developed an <strong>Android application</strong> which enables users to explore the virtual word, build buildings, buy equipment, fight monsters, upgrade soldiers and add other users as friends while walking around in real world.</li>
                  <li>Developed the <strong>backend server</strong> with Java. Handled concurrency requests with <strong>multi-thread programming</strong>, realized server-client communication with <strong>TCP socket programming, JSON and Netty</strong>, interacted <strong>Postgres</strong> database with <strong>Hibernate</strong>.</li>
                  <li>Applied <strong>Agile</strong> methodology, carried out issue tracking and CI/CD pipeline.</li>
                  <li>Carried out unit tests with <strong>JUnit</strong> framework and used <strong>Mockito</strong> to mock external dependencies.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Worked on magnetic resonance imaging <strong>(MRI) data harmonization</strong>. Developed algorithms to eliminate the differences caused by the scanner.</li>
                  <li>Calculated RISH features from the original MRI signal. Based on that, realized a <strong>linear data harmonization algorithm</strong> and a <strong>CNN machine-learning-based nonlinear algorithm</strong>.</li>
                  <li>The proposed algorithms harmonize the <strong>raw signal</strong> from scanners, eliminate the changes caused by scanners while <strong>maintaining the fiber orientation</strong> in human brain. Any derived quantity from the harmonized data can be pooled from different sites for <strong>further medical analysis</strong>.</li>
