- Developed an intuitive interface layout with a **rendering window** on the left, presenting **machine information**, and a **Q&A interface** on the right. The left-side window displayed **over 5000 STL files**, offering **dozens of buttons** and their interactive features, including model highlighting, hiding, and resetting, simulating left, middle, and right mouse button events, and displaying PDFs for individual models, among other functionalities. This allowed users to gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's machinery and significantly enhanced the user's **interactive experience** with the models.
- Imported the **langchain-chatglm project** developed by **Tsinghua University**, deploying the chatglm2-6b model as a Q&A system. Developed a **server-side component** to retrieve answers, facilitating the transmission of questions and answers through **socket connections**.  Utilized **multithreading** to handle the task of retrieving model responses, ensuring the smooth operation of the application.
- Through this project, I gained experience in the **complete software development process**: from initial assessment and discussions to development and testing. The project was successfully deployed internally within the company and received **unanimous recognition** from the **Company President** and the Research and Development department. This significantly improved the efficiency of training new employees and laid the foundation for the company's future collaborations on knowledge graph projects with external partners.
